To get started with this project, clone it down then type:
    "npm install"
    "npm start"  //it might take a second or two to compile


To use the first two API's, check the appropriate boxes then click either the required or restrict code buttons
the default setting are:

{ required: {IfStatement: false, VariableDeclaration: false, ReturnStatement: false},
 restrict:{BreakStatement: true, WithStatement: true}
 }

 The false settings for the required object are later set to true if they are found in the code

 The third API for checking against the general structure of the parsed code can be located on the right side scrolling
 down. It takes in an array of tree like structures to compare against. The key, value and children need to wrap in "".
 Below is an example to will run true to the current default code.

  [
    {"value": "IfStatement", "children":[
    {"value": "BlockStatement", "children": [
    {"value": "ExpressionStatement", "children":[]}]}
    ]},
    {"value": "ReturnStatement", "children": []}
  ]

Visual example:

    "IfStatement"
      "BlockStatement"
        "ExpressionStatement"
    "ReturnStatement"
